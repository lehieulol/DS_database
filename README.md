# Group 20: Airline Flight Analysis and Prediction
## Crawler:
Data crawling can be done by running `DataScaper/Scaper.py`. Destination for gathered data is the folder `Database`.
## Data Preprocessing, Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis:
After gathering data in `Database` folder, `PreprocessingAndEDA` should be checked:
* Raw data cleaning should first be done by running `data_cleaning.ipynb`.
* After that, perform preprocessing by running `data_preprocessing.ipynb`.
* Details of our analysis on the preprocessed data are in `data_analysis.ipynb`.
## Models:
Models training can be performed on the preprocessed data as in `models.ipynb`, in the folder `Models`.
